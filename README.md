# ERP-MSSQL-C-DISCLAIMER(I DID ONLY THINGS RELATED TO THE DATABASE AND SQL SCRIPTS, I SHARE CREDIT FOR THIS PROJECT WITH A FRIEND)
$An ERP program with some simple functions using MSSQL and Visual Studio's Windows Forms App(.NET framework) with C#
$This was a project done with the help of a fellow student at the academy, an ERP with addition and deletion of customers, vendors, products, salespeople and of sales.
$We used the AdventureWorks 2022 database for this project.
$I completely oversaw the database part of the project analyzing the database and making the sql scripts while my partner managed the C# and forms part of it.
$This was a project to get better at using forms and the sql language, alas i was only able to deepen my sql knowledge, still i believe it was a fruitful journey.
$The scripts have mostly solid structure but there are mistakes since it was a learning process
--The ALL textfile contains all and some more of the sql scripts used for the database it is my part of the work!!!!
