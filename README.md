# ERP-MSSQL-C-
An ERP program with some simple functions using MSSQL and Visual Studio's Windows Forms App(.NET framework) with C#
This was a project done with the help of a fellow student at the academy, an ERP with addition and deletion of customers, vendors, products, salespeople and of sales.
We used the AdventureWorks 2022 database for this project.
I completely oversaw the database part of the project analyzing the database and making the sql scripts while my partner managed the C# and forms part of it.
This was a project to get better at using forms and the sql language, alas i was only able to deepen my sql knowledge, still i believe it was a fruitful journey.
The scripts have mostly solid structure but there are mistakes since it was a learning process
